# Climate - Malaria Nexus

This project focuses on understanding the relationship between climatic factors, it lagged features and Malaria burden in Benue State.
The outcome of this project is to provide a pilot policy brief for proactive decion making by policy makers to enable the elimination of malaria in Nigeria.
The state use for this case study is Benue state having the following data variables such as Temperature, Rainfall, Persons who tested positive for malaria, the 23 LGA and persons with fever.

The project further trained and deployed an AI model that predicts the number of malaria cases based off input parameters such as Rainfall(mm), Temperature (degree celsuis), lagged features and persons with fever. The model trained is to help policy makers targeted interventions program considering the climatic and extrem conditions such as flooding. You can find the delopyed model here: 

## Limitations

This project faced number of limitations such as Data scarcity, Data incompleteness and Data Variability. And this limitations are expected as the data are secondary data and public data that could have being tampered with.

## Next Steps
With more robust Datasets and availability key variables from the 36 states or from key geopolical zones in nigeria, the project will be improved on such that, the trained model will be incorporated into the Nigeria DHIS2 through it API to provide a real time predictions and shapes interventions.
